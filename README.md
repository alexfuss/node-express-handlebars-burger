# node-express-handlebars-burger
Node Express Handlebars

A burger logger built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, with the MVC concept. Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to render the HTML views.

# How it works:
1. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

4. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
